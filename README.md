## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
<p align="center">
<b>⚠️A BETA OF THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET⚠️<b><br>
The software is based on a minimal search bar,
which can be activated with a combination of keys.<br>
It allows you to search for files and folders on Windows,
but also do in-depth searches on specific websites using commands (e.g. -yt)
